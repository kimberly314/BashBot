BashBot consists of the KimberlyBot shell script and two accompanying text files, wildnights and jabberwocky.

KimberlyBot is a command line chatbot that will ask questions, print poems, and record date ideas.   
Additionally, if your name is Jessie, it will flirt with you.  

This program was written while practicing shell scripting and with the intended audience of only my partner, 
but she said I could share it with all of you.   

KimberlyBot will create a "Date-a-base" with your date ideas if you like.  

Wildnights and jabberwocky are files that contain the text of the poems.

Have fun!
